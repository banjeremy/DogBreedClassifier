# Dog Breed Classifier

This project was inspired by an assignment in [Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) program. The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network to classify dog breeds given an image. I used [Keras](https://keras.io/) / [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to transfer the [Xception](https://keras.io/applications/#xception) model (originally trained on [Imagenet](http://www.image-net.org/)) to classify on a custom dog breed training set. If you're interested, you can check out the [notebook I used](./CreateModel.ipynb) to create the model.
