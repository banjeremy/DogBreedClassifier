# Dog Breed Classifier

![demo](demo.gif)

This project was inspired by an assignment in Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program. I'm using transfer learning to convert the Xception model to classify dog breeds. You can check out the [/notebook I used](./CreateModel.ipynb) to create the model.

* Model trained in Keras / Tensorflow
* Converted to CoreML
* Imported into iOS project utilizing real-time predictions using the camera feed
